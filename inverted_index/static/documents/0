Biography
Lawyer by education, graduated from the postgraduate course of the Faculty of Law of Nizhny Novgorod State University in 2007[7]. Until 2005, he worked as an investigator in the Shahunya prosecutor's decutor's sector's art.[7]. He was dismissed "for committing an act defaming the honor of a prosecutor". According to the Celestial Empire himself - for opposing the torture of prisoners and falsification of reports[5]. He described his experience in the prosecutor's office in the samizdat "In the second circle"[1][7].

After being dismissed from the prosecutor's office, the Celestial Empire engaged in activism, organized rallies and meetings in Nizhny Novgorod against the inflated tariffs for overhaul and building compactors. From 2007 to 2011, he held actions against the cruel treatment of homeless animals, in 2018 he opposed the liquidation of the zoo[5]. In one of the news stories of Nizhny Novgorod television, he protected the lawn in the yard of his house from utility workers. Celestial Empire threw himself under the lawnmower, trying to save the grass and dandelions, which, according to him, "collect dust and give oxygen"[8].

In 2011, the Middle Kingdom and his wife were resting on Lake Svetloyar, where they were attacked by two drunk people. The Celestial Empire had a mushroom knife with it, with which he wounded the attacker in the stomach. The Celestial Empire was accused of attempted murder, but then the charge was reclassified under Article 111 ("deliberate infliction of serious harm to health") and Article 318 ("use of violence against a representative of the authorities") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, as he sprayed a gas canister in the face of the policeman who came to interrogate him in connection with the incident on the lake[9]. The Celestial Empire was sentenced to a suspended sentence of four years. He claims that it was a provocation - the attackers were hired by developers, whom he prevented with his rallies[5].

Incel movement (2016-n.)
In 2016, the Middle Kingdom divorced his wife. He began to study the issues of relations between men and women, got to the English-language forums of the Incels and became interested in this movement. Having combined his own theory of "vaginocapitalism" (from the words "vagina" and "capitalism") with Western terminology, he began to gather supporters and form an incel movement in Russia[10][11]. The Celestial Empire movement gained popularity in 2018-2019, when he became the main character of the show on NTV dedicated to relationships, where he said that he was a virgin until the age of 30 and was not popular with women[12]. He was also a participant of one of the issues of the program "Male / Female", where he complained about failures in his personal life[8].

I was the best student in my young years, I was awarded a medal for the best scientific work. And I haven't had a girlfriend for ten years. I was not considered a person at all, so to speak. When I wrote about it, some writer told me that they did the right thing. For them, a real man is such a baboon who walks, sends everyone there, goes over the heads.

The blogger also calls for fighting feminism, which he calls "femfascism"[13]. The media call the Celestial Empire the leader and leader of the Incel movement in Russia[2][3][8].

The theory of vaginal capitalism
I need sex to live, to do good. If you give me sex, I will come back to life again, I will be able to earn 100 thousand a month.
- An example of the Celestial Empire's statement about the inaccessibility of sex[14]
The Celestial Empire based its concept on Karl Marx's ideas about gender equality. According to the Celestial Empire, men are deprived of the right to sex by women, every married man is forced to pay for sex - to bring home a salary and give gifts[5][12][15][16]. The Celestial Empire claims that sex is a public duty of women, but they "trade" the opportunity to sleep with themselves and provide it not to all men, but to a select few[4][14]He accuses women who "do not give sex" of a high proportion of divorces, early male mortality, wars and other global problems[17]. "Sex is the only resource on Earth that men need vitally," said the Celestial Empire. Orgasm is not the purpose of sex, it is needed to exchange "sexual energy", without which a man fails[8].

In June 2024, it became known that the Russian student referred to the author of the idea of vaginal capitalism in an essay for the USE and received a high score for her creative work[18].

In the Runet, the Celestial Empire became a hero of memes, which were based on his eccentric behavior and numerous requests to "give him sex"[13]. The phrase of the Celestial Empire became popular: "I need sex at any cost, but for free"[8].

In November 2019, the Nizhny Novgorod police opened an administrative case against the Celestial Empire under Art. 20.3.1 Administrative Code ("Incitement to hatred or enmity, as well as humiliation of human dignity") due to a number of resonant misogynous statements, which included calls to mitigate the criminal punishment for rape[2]. In December 2019, the Nizhny Novgorod District Court decided to arrest the Celestial Empire for seven days[10], but after the appeal, the case was sent for review, the results are unknown[19].

Involuntary psychiatric hospitalization (2021-2022)
In 2021, Celestial Empire, who at that time was a medical college student, spoke on the topic of school jokes in his blog in VKontakte. Nizhny Novgorod politician Roman Zykov, who was the coordinator of the "National Liberation Movement" and a deputy of the City Duma, paid attention to the records and complained. In these records, as the statement on the Celestial Empire says, he acquitted the murderers. In addition, the parents of several fellow students of the Celestial Empire signed an appeal to the director of the college with a request to "protect the children" from the Celestial Empire. The activist himself says that he was only looking for the reason for such actions, and found it in "involuntary abstinence from sex". On October 8, 2021, the Celestial Empire was detained by the FSB. He claims that FSB operatives called an ambulance, but the doctors refused to hospitalize him without seeing the grounds. Then the operatives simply took him to the Nizhny Novgorod psychiatric hospital â„– 2. On October 11, the hospital appealed to the Leninsky District Court with a request to authorize the involuntary hospitalization of the Celestial Empire. The visiting session of the Lenin Court was held in a psychiatric hospital. The Middle Kingdom insisted that he never approved of the shootings, but as a blogger he reacted to noticeable social events. The need for hospitalization in court was justified by psychiatrist Lala Kasimova[20]. The court decided to involuntarily hospitalize the Middle Kingdom for six months[16][21][22]. In the hospital, the hands, neck, body of the Celestial Empire were bitten by bedbugs, which was recorded by the representative of the human rights commissioner in the Nizhny Novgorod region[23]. On October 28, he was released to a day hospital. The Celestial Empire associates hospitalization with its public activities, Radio Liberty called it "the first case of involuntary hospitalization of an oppositionist"[20].

In February 2022, the Middle Kingdom challenged forced hospitalization[23], the court found it illegal[24]. He sued the Ministry of Finance of Russia for illegal placement in a mental hospital for 60 thousand rubles[25].

In June 2022, the Avtozavodsky District Court of Nizhny Novgorod imposed an administrative fine of 30 thousand rubles on the Celestial Empire because of a post in social networks, in which he said that the money spent by Russia for one day of the "special operation" in Ukraine would be enough to provide all houses in Nizhny Novgorod with hot water supply. The court decision said that in its publication the Celestial Empire separated the word "special operation" with quotation marks, which, according to the court, "certainly testifies to the ironic, opposite, derogatory meaning of the above word"[26].

Accusation of sex with a minor (2024)
In April 2024, the head of the "Safe Internet League" Ekaterina Mizulina demanded that law enforcement officers check Alexei the Middle Kingdom. In her opinion, he distributes "destructive content", harasses girls and threatens them, publishes their personal data and "distributes pedophile materials". Celestial celestial called Mizulin's statements a lie and slander[27]. The case was not opened.

On August 19, 2024, the Celestial Empire was detained in St. Petersburg. Earlier, Mizulina accused him of propaganda of pedophilia and promised to contact the Investigative Committee in connection with the video in which the Celestial Empire kisses and holds a 15-year-old girl's chest. The Celestial Empire, in turn, claims that she introduced herself as a 23-year-old, and denies sex with her in "any form"[3][4][19]. Later it became known that two criminal cases were initiated against the Celestial Empire under articles on sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 (part 1 of Article 134 of the Criminal Code) and on committing depraved acts without using violence against a person under the age of 16 (part 1 of Article 135 of the Criminal Code)[19][28]. On August 21, the Middle Kingdom pleaded guilty to depraved sexual acts against a minor and asked the court to choose a preventive measure in the form of house arrest, but the Smolninsky Court of St. Petersburg sent him to the pre-trial detention center[29][30][31]. During the exit from the meeting room, the Celestial Empire said that he was threatened with death[32].

According to the investigation of "Paper", in numerous videos and posts that the Celestial Empire posted before the detention, he accused his ex-wife Valeria of initiating a campaign to write complaints against him for the sake of revenge. The Telegram channel, which belongs to the former wife of the Celestial Empire, really published a template of Mizulina's appeal about the connection of the Celestial Empire with a 15-year-old girl. According to "Paper" sources, the episode was covered by several small bloggers and Telegram channels that conducted doxing: they found the girl's page, established her age according to a classmate, and also contacted her mother. The channel administrator, which has been publishing information about the Celestial Empire since 2020, wrote about five statements to the police and a complaint at the place of study of the Celestial Empire on suspicion of justifying pedophilia long before Mizulina became interested in the case[13].

On August 22, 2024, Valeria, the former wife of the Celestial Empire, said that she had delivered 30 kg of table salt to the detention center; by this, she exhausted the monthly limit on transfers for the detainee[33][34]. The press service of the Federal Penitentiary Service said that this is not true[35].
